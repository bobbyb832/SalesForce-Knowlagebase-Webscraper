  This code was built on my free time for the company that I worked for. This is only a demonstration of my ability to code in python, use libraries, functions, and basic syntax to achieve a desired task.

What is this project?
  This program is mainly a backup utility that downloads knowledgebase articles from a website.

Why was it made?
  While working as a tech support representative we would use a ”Knowledgebase”, a repository that held useful information about our equipment, and how to solve certain issues, useful contacts, etc... Often times the server would go down and we wouldn’t have a local back up on our computers which made it difficult if we came across something we didn’t know. With my managers permission I coded this project on my free time to resolve the issue we were facing, and to put my programming knowledge to use.

Requirements:
	-Python 3 needs to be installed
	-Must be ran on a windows operating system
	-Must have the selenium library installed with google chrome driver
  -Must be able to log into the web-based knowlage base 

Later versions would have included:
	-user interface
	-be able to dynamically set a path to store all the html files in
	-run selenium in the background
